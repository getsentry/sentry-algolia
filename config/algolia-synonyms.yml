# Each list item is a new synonym group. Each item in the group will be treated
# as the same. That is, if you search "google", you will get all results for
# google as well as "GCP Functions", with the results weighted equally.

  - ['google', 'gcp functions']
  - ['amazon', 'aws lambda']
  - ['apm', 'performance']

  - ['vue', 'vuejs']

# Each list itme is a new one way synonym. The left side is a term is the
# preferred term, while the right side is a list of terms that will also
# be included in its results, but not vice versa. For example, a search
# for "invoice" will include results for "pricing", but a search for "pricing"
# will not include results for "invoice".
oneWaySynonym:
  'invoice': ['pricing']
  'golang': ['go']
  'scala': ['java']
  'c#': ['.net']
  'html': ['javascript']
  'serverless': ['aws lambda', 'gcp functions']
  'cloud': ['aws lambda', 'gcp functions', 'azure functions']
  'microservices': ['aws lambda', 'gcp functions', 'azure functions']

# Each item is an alternative correction. Despite the name, it does not correct
# the search term but rather also defines other terms to show results for,
# but at a lower rank. The left side term is the queried term while the right
# is alternative terms that rank lower. For example, a search for "reach" will
# also include results for "react" but they will appear lower in the list.
altCorrection1:
  'reach': ['react']
  'lamda': ['lambda']
